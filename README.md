3. **Launch the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## Project Layout

- **Components:** All the React components are inside the `src/components` folder.
- **Assets:** Any static files, like images and styles, are located in `src/assets`.
- **Utilities:** Helper functions and utilities can be found in `src/utils`.

## Important Notes
